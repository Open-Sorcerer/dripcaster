Unlocking Farcaster powered e-commerce for Drip Creators

### What does it do

- It is a platform for Drip creators to sell digital products (videos, e-books, art) via Farcaster Frames.
- Users can discover and purchase these digital assets by minting Access NFTs, which grant them access to the purchased content.

### How does it work?

- Creators list their digital products (videos, e-books, images) on the platform, which are encrypted.
- Users can discover and purchase these products by minting Access NFTs through the Post Frame.
- After purchasing the Access NFT, users can view their purchased digital assets on the Viewing Page.

### How is it made

- We are allowing the minting of Access NFTs via Farcaster Frames. 
- The NFTs are minted on Base and Solana. 
- We are using Wormhole to enable cross-chain compatibility. 

### Future Features

- Developing a mobile app for a better user experience.
- Implementing actions like commenting, rating, and sharing of digital assets on top of Farcaster.
